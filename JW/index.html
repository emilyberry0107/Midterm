        John Wick was a movie that not many peopel attened when it was in theaters, because the public thought it woudl be a flop.  John wick was no where near the expectations, it exceded these expectations and created an amazing franchise that would go on for two more films and possibly more by how the thrid film was left in a cliff hanger.  The film had a very actracting story line and plot, there was a lot of action scences, which drew my attention.  The action was not over the top or unrealistic, they did a really good job to make the scences seem that an individual could do these thigns with much training and discipline.  Teh actor choice was unexpected, but Keanu Reeves did an excellent job portraying his charactor and doing his part in the action sequences.
