            The Maze Runner is the first film and book of its series.  The film follows the book to a T and does not stray from what was written in the book.  From how the female character was described in the book, I did not expect the actress that was chosen for the film.  I feel that the actress did not protray the character very well, so I was not a big fan of the actor choice for this character.  Aside from the choice of actress I feel that the film was excellently made, and the next two films made are even better.
