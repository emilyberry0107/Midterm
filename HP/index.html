            This film is the first of its eight film series and still is one of my favorites of the series.  The sepcial effects were well produced and the actors chosen embodied their chactors very well.  For being the first film of a series it was not too slow and showed the plot and backgorund of the storyline and charactors rather quickly.  The film story line followed teh book very closley with little to no changed of charactors or scenes.  They did leave the openign scene form teh book out of the movie, which I think was a good choice since it is a small part that does nto really relate to the story line since it is stated in the movie at the beginning.
