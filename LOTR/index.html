            With being the first film in the trilogy, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, is not the best of the three films that were made.  As always the first film of any trilogy or series can be considered one of the slower movies.  The first films are a backstory or the setup for the next films to come.  This being said Fellowship of the Ring was an excellent film and start for the next two films that will proceed it.  The film follows the book very closely, with a few characters added.  It does have slow start but there is alwasy somehting that draws the viewer into the film.  This film is a set up that introduces all the characters and the task that they are given to complete throughtout the rest of the trilogy. There are a few tear jerking scenes in the movie, so these scenes are not for those that eaisly cry.  The actors were excellent choices for their respective roles, they presented and made these characters come to life.  I am a person that likes action within movies, so since the film did not have as much action as its proceeeding films I feel that out of the three Lord of the Rings films that were made Fellowship of the Ring is not the best of the trilogy.  The film was excellently produced; the location, special effects, and makeup were all excelent quality.
